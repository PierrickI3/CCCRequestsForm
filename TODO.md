What happens on the review page when a request is closed?  We want the item to disappear but like the isDeleted flag, it needs to remain in the DB for reporting purposes.
Iâ€™ve added a field to the requirements document to capture Date/Time Request Raised.  It would be nice to see this on the review requests form.
Can you make the Requested Date/Time field visible on the review form as well please.
